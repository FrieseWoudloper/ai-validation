# Decision Log

Throughout our work, small decisions about processes and approaches are often made in meetings and chats.
While these aren't big enough for formal documentation like ADRs, capturing them is valuable for both
current and future team members.

This log provides a reference point for those decisions.

## Overview of decisions

* We keep project ADRs in the relevant project.
* When we encounter a bug in our software, we create a regression test to reproduce it.
 When the bug is solved, the regression test is updated to reflect the solved situation.
