# Onboarding

- Start by setting up your [dev machine](dev-machine.md).
- Then create your [accounts](accounts.md).
- Read our [ADRs](../../adrs/0001-adrs.md).
- Read our [principles](../principles.md).
- Read our [Decision Log](../decision-log.md).
- Finally, add yourself to our [team page](../../about/team.md) (you can stay anonymous if you want, see
  our [principles](../principles.md)).
