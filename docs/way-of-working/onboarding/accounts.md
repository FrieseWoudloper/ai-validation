## Secrets

We use [HashiCorp Vault](https://vault.apps.digilab.network/) secrets manager for team secrets. You can login with a
[GitHub Personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The token needs organization read
permissions (`read:org`), and you should be part of our GitHub team to access the vault.
