# TAD

TAD is the acronym for **T**ransparency of **A**lgorithmic **D**ecision making. TAD has the goal to make algorithmic
systems more transparent; it achieves this by generating standardized reports on the algorithmic system which
encompasses both technical aspects in addition to descriptive information about the system and regulatory assessments.
For both the system and the model the lifecycle is important and this needs to be taken into account. The definition
for an algorithm is derived from the [Algoritmeregister](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/nl/footer/over-algoritmes).

On the one hand the TAD project is focused on building a standardized format of reporting on a algorithmic system by
developing a [Reporting Standard](Reporting-Standard/index.md). This Reporting Standard consists out of a
[System Card](Reporting-Standard/index.md#system_card) which contains
[Model Cards](Reporting-Standard/index.md#model_card) and
[Assessment Cards](Reporting-Standard/index.md#assessment_card).

On the other hand the project is focused on filling in the System, Model and
Assessment Cards with both performance metrics and technical measurements on fairness and bias of the model,
assessments on the system where the specific algorithm resides, and descriptive information about the system.
The requirements and instruments are dictated by the [Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/).
