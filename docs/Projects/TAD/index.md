# TAD

TAD is the abbreviation of Transparency of Algorithmic Decision Making, the goal is to make algorithmic systems more
transparent by generating standardized reports on the algorithmic system for both it's technical element as well as the
surrounding system. For both the model and the system the lifecycle is important and this needs to be taken into
account.

The TAD project is focused on one hand building the standardized format of reporting on an algorithmic system by
extending on the format of [Industry Standard](Reporting-Standard%2Findex.md). On the other hand the project is focused
on filling in the system- and model cards with both technical metrics & measurements of the exact model as theoretical
assessments on the system where the specific algorithm resides. The requirements and instruments are dictated by the
[Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/).

## FAQ

Is TAD an AI Governance Platform?

While TAD will generate standardized reporting, and you are able to edit reporting of algorithmic systems the
governance/management aspect of different models is currently out of scope for this project. To keep track, compare,
and alert on models a different approach should be taken but could very much be the follow-up from this project.

Is TAD a tool?

While the project does not aim to be just another tool, the current tools we have compared in the market are
shortcoming therefore with ADR (XXX) we are proposing to make a set of tools which will help us realize the goal
of filling in the standardized reporting format for algorithmic systems.
