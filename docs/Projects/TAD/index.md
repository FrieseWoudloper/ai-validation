# TAD

TAD is the acronym for **T**ransparency of **A**lgorithmic **D**ecision making. TAD has the goal to make algorithmic
systems more transparent; it achieves this by generating standardized reports on the algorithmic system which
encompasses both technical aspects in addition to descriptive information about the system and regulatory assessments.
For both the system and the model the lifecycle is important and this needs to be taken into account. The definition
for an algorithm is derived from the [Algoritmeregister](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/nl/footer/over-algoritmes).

On the one hand the TAD project is focused on building a standardized format of reporting on a algorithmic system by
developing a [Reporting Standard](Reporting-Standard). This Reporting Standard consists out of a System Card which
contains Model Cards and Assessment Cards. On the other hand the project is focused on filling in the System, Model and
Assessment Cards with both performance metrics and technical measurements on fairness and bias of the model and
assessments on the system where the specific algorithm resides. The requirements and instruments are dictated by the
[Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/).

## FAQ

Is TAD an AI Governance Platform?

While TAD will generate a standardized report and you are able to edit report of algorithmic systems, the
governance/management aspect of different models is currently out of scope for this project. To keep track, compare,
and alert on models a different approach should be taken but could very much be the follow-up from this project.

Is TAD a tool?

While the project does not aim to be just another tool, the existing tools we have compared in the market are
not sufficient to our needs. Therefore, with ADR (XXX) we are proposing to make a set of tools which will help us
realize the goal of filling in the standardized reporting format for algorithmic systems.
