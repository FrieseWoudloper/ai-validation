# ADR-0017 Laptop Security

## Context

When people leave their laptop open and unlocked this could be a big security breach, especially when you have SSO on
for multiple services.

## Decision

Whenever a colleague will find your laptop open and unlocked, they will message in the `random` Mattermost channel of 
the Rijks AI Validation team to bring cookies and cake to the office the next thursday as a way of compensation.

## Risks

- We could have a big security breach if people leave their laptops unlocked and unattended.
- People could become less healthy by eating many cookies.
- People could become less trusting of other colleagues if they would be punished by bringing cookies to the office.

## Assumptions
- Everybody is in the RAV team in Mattermost
- "Next Thursday" is assumed to be the office-day where most people are in the office of choice
- This won't be abused by colleagues wanting to have free treats
