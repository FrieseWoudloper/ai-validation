# ADR-0017 Laptop Security

## Context

When people leave their laptop open and unlocked this could be a big security breach, especially when you have SSO on
for multiple services.

## Decision

Whenever a colleague will find your laptop open and unlocked, they will message in the `random` Mattermost channel to
bring cookies and cake to the office the next thursday as a way of compensation.

## Risks

- We could have a big security breach if people leave their laptops unlocked and unmanaged.
- People could become less healthy by eating many cookies.
- People could become less trusting of other colleagues if they would be punished by bringing cookies to the office.
