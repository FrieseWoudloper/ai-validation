## Context

Our development team wants to implement a CI/CD solution to streamline the build,
testing, and deployment workflows of our software products. Currently, our codebase resides on GitHub, and we leverage
Kubernetes as our chosen orchestration platform, managed by the DigiLab platform team.

## Decision

We will use the following tools for CI/CD pipeline:

* Continuous Integration (CI): GitHub Actions will be employed to facilitate the automated testing of our applications.
* Continuous Deployment (CD): We will utilize Flux for managing the deployment process of our applications. Flux reads
from [github](https://github.com/MinBZK/ai-validation-infra) to deploy.

## Consequences

GitHub Actions aligns with our existing infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration with our codebase and minimizing
operational overhead. GitHub Actions' specific syntax for CI results in vendor lock-in, necessitating significant effort
to migrate to an alternative CI system in the future.

Flux, being a GitOps operator for Kubernetes, offers a declarative approach to managing deployments, enhancing
reliability and repeatabilty within our Kubernetes ecosystem.
