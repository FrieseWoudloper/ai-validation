# ADR-0006 Agile tooling

## Context

Our development team wants to enhance transparency and productivity in our software development processes.
We are using GitHub for version control and collaboration. However, to further streamline our process, there is a need
to incorporate tooling for managing the effort of our team.

## Decision

We will use GitHub Projects as our agile process tool

## Consequences

[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
seamlessly integrates with our existing GitHub repositories, allowing us to manage our Agile processes.
within the same ecosystem where our code resides. This integration eliminates the need for additional third-party tools,
simplifying our workflow.
