# AMT

AMT is the acronym for Algorithm Management Toolkit. AMT has the goal to make algorithmic
systems more transparent; it achieves this by generating standardized reports on the algorithmic system which
encompasses both technical aspects in addition to descriptive information about the system and regulatory assessments.
For both the system and the model the lifecycle is important and this needs to be taken into account. The definition
for an algorithm is derived from the [Algoritmeregister](https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/nl/footer/over-algoritmes).

One of the goals of the TAD project is providing a standardized format of reporting on an algorithmic
system by developing a [Reporting Standard](reporting-standard/index.md). This Reporting Standard consists out of a
[System Card](reporting-standard/index.md#system_card) which contains
[Model Cards](reporting-standard/index.md#model_card) and
[Assessment Cards](reporting-standard/index.md#assessment_card).

The final result of the project is producing System, Model and Assessment Cards with both performance metrics
and technical measurements on fairness and bias of the model, assessments on the system where the specific
algorithm resides, and descriptive information about the system.

The requirements and instruments are dictated by the [Algoritmekader](https://minbzk.github.io/Algoritmekader/).
