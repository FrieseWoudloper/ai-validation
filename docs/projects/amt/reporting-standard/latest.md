This document describes the Algorithm Management Toolkit (AMT) Reporting Standard.

For reproducibility, governance, auditing and sharing of algorithmic systems it is essential to have a reporting
standard so that information about an algorithmic system can be shared. This reporting standard describes how
information about the different phases of an algorithm's life cycle can be reported. It contains, among other things,
descriptive information combined with information about the technical tests and tasks applied.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"

    The AMT Reporting Standard is work in progress. This means that the current standard is probably suboptimal and will
    change significantly in future versions.

## Introduction

Inspired by [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and
[Papers with Code Model Index](https://github.com/paperswithcode/model-index) this standard almost[^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]
extends the
[Hugging Face model card metadata specification](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/modelcard.md?plain=1)
to allow for:

1. More fine-grained information on performance metrics, by extending the `metrics_field` from the Hugging
   Face metadata specification.
2. Capturing additional *measurements* on fairness and bias, which can be partitioned into bar plot like
   measurements (such as mean absolute SHAP values) and graph plot like measurements (such as partial dependence). This
   is achieved by defining a new field `measurements`.
3. Capturing *tasks* or *tools* (such as
   [IAMA](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2021/02/25/impact-assessment-mensenrechten-en-algoritmes)
   and [ALTAI](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/assessment-list-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-altai-self-assessment)).
   This is achieved by defining a new field `tasks`.

Following Hugging Face, this proposed standard will be written in YAML.

This standard does not contain all fields present in the Hugging Face metadata specification. The fields that are
optional in the Hugging Face specification and are specific to the Hugging Face interface are omitted.

Another difference is that we divide our implementation into three separate parts.

1. `system_card`, containing information about a group of ML-models which accomplish a specific task.
2. `model_card`, containing information about a specific data science model.
3. `task_card`, containing information about a regulatory task.

!!! note "Include statements"

    These `model_card`s and  `task_card`s  can be included verbatim into a `system_card`, or referenced with an
    `!include` statement, allowing for minimal cards to be compact in a single file. Extensive cards can be split up for
    readability and maintainability. Our standard allows for the `!include` to be used anywhere.

## Specification of the standard

The standard will be written in YAML. Example YAML files are given in the next section. The standard defines three
cards: a `system_card`, a `model_card` and an `task_card`. A `system_card` contains information about an
algorithmic system. It can have multiple models and each of these models should have a `model_card`. Regulatory
tasks can be processed in an `task_card`. Note that `model_card`'s and `task_card`'s can be included
directly into the `system_card` or can be included as separate YAML files with help of a YAML-include mechanism. For
clarity the latter is preferred and is also used in the examples in the next section.

[^1]: Deviation from the Hugging Face specification is in the License field. Hugging Face only accepts dataset id's
      from [Hugging Face license list](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-licenses) while we accept any
      license from [Open Source License List](https://opensource.org/license).

[^2]: Deviation from the Hugging Face specification is in the `model_index:results:dataset` field. Hugging Face only
      accepts one dataset, while we accept a list of datasets.

[^3]: Deviation from the Hugging Face specification is in the Dataset Type field. Hugging Face only accepts dataset id's
      from [Hugging Face datasets](https://hf.co/datasets) while we also allow for any url pointing to the dataset.

[^4]: For this extension to work relevant metrics (such as for example false positive rate) have to be added to the
      [Hugging Face metrics](https://hf.co//metrics), possibly this can be done in our organizational namespace.
